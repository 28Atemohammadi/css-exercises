# Exercise 4 - Chaining Selectors

## Description
This exercise focuses on learning how to **chain multiple class selectors** in CSS to apply styles to elements that share one class but differ in others. Two images are styled using combinations of the same base class (`avatar`) with different secondary classes (`proportioned` and `distorted`).

## Tasks Completed
- Applied a `width` of `300px` to the image with classes `avatar proportioned`, and used automatic height to preserve its square ratio.
- Applied a `width` of `200px` and `height` of `400px` to the image with classes `avatar distorted`.
- Used **chained class selectors** (e.g. `.avatar.proportioned`) to target elements more specifically.

## What I Learned
- How to use multiple class names in HTML.
- How to chain selectors in CSS to apply specific styles to elements that share one or more classes.
- The difference between maintaining proportions using `height: auto` vs. hardcoding dimensions.

## Outcome
Two images:
- One retains square proportions.
- The other appears stretched vertically (distorted).
