# Class and ID Selectors - CSS Exercise

## 📝 Description

This exercise is part of The Odin Project’s CSS Foundations curriculum.  
The purpose of this task is to practice using **class** and **ID** selectors to style HTML elements with CSS.

## 🎯 What I Practiced

- Adding `class` and `id` attributes to HTML elements
- Using CSS selectors: `.` for class and `#` for id
- Applying multiple classes to a single element
- Using different types of color values (e.g., HEX, RGB, or HSL)
- Organizing styles based on similarities and uniqueness of elements

## 📌 Requirements

- All **odd-numbered elements** should share a class:
  - Light red/pink background
  - Font family: `Verdana`, `DejaVu Sans`, and fallback `sans-serif`
- The **second element** (div) should have a unique ID:
  - Blue text
  - Font size: `36px`
- The **third element** (p) should have:
  - The same class as the odd elements
  - An additional font size of `24px`
- The **fourth element** (div) should have a unique ID:
  - Light green background
  - Font size: `24px`
  - Bold text

## ✅ Self-Check

- [x] Odd-numbered `p` elements share a class
- [x] Even-numbered `div` elements have unique IDs
- [x] The third element uses multiple classes
