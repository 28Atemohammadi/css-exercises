# CSS Foundations â€“ Cascade Fix

This exercise focuses on understanding how **CSS specificity** and **rule order** affect the final appearance of elements in the browser. Instead of writing new rules, you will be editing existing CSS rules to resolve conflicts and apply the desired styles correctly.

## âœ… Objectives

- Understand how the CSS cascade works.
- Identify and fix issues related to specificity and rule order.
- Practice resolving style conflicts without changing the HTML structure.

## ðŸ“Œ Instructions

- Do **not** modify the `index.html` file.
- Only edit the `styles.css` file.
- You can:
  - Add, remove, or modify selectors in CSS rules.
  - Reorder CSS blocks if necessary.
- You cannot:
  - Change the actual CSS property values.
  - Add or remove elements in the HTML.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Practiced

- The Cascade and its decision process.
- Specificity hierarchy:
  1. Inline styles
  2. ID selectors
  3. Class, attribute, and pseudo-class selectors
  4. Type selectors and pseudo-elements
- Rule order: later rules override earlier ones when specificity is equal.

## âœ… Self Check

- [ ] You did **not** edit the HTML file.
- [ ] All elements visually match the desired outcome.
- [ ] All CSS changes target valid HTML elements.

Happy Cascading! ðŸŽ¨
