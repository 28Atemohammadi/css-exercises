🧾 Exercise: CSS Margin and Padding Practice
🎯 Objective
This exercise is designed to help you practice how to use margin and padding in CSS to control spacing inside and around HTML elements.

📁 Project Structure
index.html – Basic HTML structure (do not edit this file)

style.css – CSS file where you will apply changes (only edit where instructed)

✅ Requirements / Outcome Checklist
Make sure the following layout is achieved:

Div One and Div Three should have 32px padding between the text and the border.

Div One should have 12px margin from any other element.

There should be a 48px gap between Div Two and Div Three.

Div Three must be aligned to the right side of the page.

The alignment of Div Three must be done using margin only (do not use float, flexbox, or other layout methods).

⚠️ Important Notes
Do not edit the HTML.

Do not add or remove CSS properties — only modify the values of existing margin and padding properties.

Pixel-perfect matching is not required — focus on understanding spacing behavior.
