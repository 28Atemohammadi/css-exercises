# Exercise 01 - CSS Methods

This exercise is about practicing the three different ways to apply CSS to HTML:
- External CSS (via a separate `.css` file)
- Internal CSS (using a `<style>` tag inside the HTML)
- Inline CSS (using the `style` attribute inside HTML elements)

Each element (div, paragraph, button) has been styled using a different method.  
This project is part of The Odin Projectâ€™s curriculum.
