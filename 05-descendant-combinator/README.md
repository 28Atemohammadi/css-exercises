# Exercise 05: Descendant Combinator

## Description

This exercise focuses on using the **descendant combinator** in CSS to apply styles only to elements that are nested inside other elements. In this case, we are applying specific styles to `<p>` elements that are **descendants of a `<div>`** element.

## What I Learned

- How the descendant combinator (`selector1 selector2`) works
- How to target elements based on their position in the HTML hierarchy
- Practice using type selectors in combination with structure

## Requirements

- Only the `<p>` elements that are **descendants of a `<div>`** should be styled.
- The following styles were applied:
  - Background color: `yellow`
  - Text color: `red`
  - Font size: `20px`
  - Text alignment: `center`

## Self Check ✅

- [x] The elements with the text “This should be styled” have the correct styles.
- [x] The elements with the text “This should be unstyled” have no styles applied.
